# BMI Calculator

A simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator built with React to help users get familiar with the `useState` hook. This project is bootstrapped using Vite for a fast and efficient development experience.

## Features

- Calculate BMI based on user input (weight and height).
- Display BMI category (Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, Obesity).
- Built with React, utilizing the `useState` hook for state management.

## Learn About the `useState` Hook

The `useState` hook is a fundamental part of React for managing component-level state. In this project:

- `useState` is used to handle user input for weight and height.
- It also tracks the calculated BMI value and category.

Refer to the [React useState documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState) for more details.
